# Pac-man: A Chinese Ghost Story

Vanilla javaScript Game with HTML and CSS

This is a re-imagined Pac-man with a "Chinese Ghost Story- 倩女幽魂" theme. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Chinese_Ghost_Story

The hero, Billie(宁采臣), starts at the bottom of the maze and attempts to rescue the damsel-in-distress Pinky(小倩) who is stranded at the top right corner, from the ghosts(树精姥姥).
